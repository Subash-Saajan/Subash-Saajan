# 👋 Hey, I'm Subash Saajan  
### Full-Stack & Android Developer | React • Node.js • Jetpack Compose • AWS  

I’m a Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building things that solve real problems and feel good to use. I like keeping things simple , clean UI, efficient backend, and code that’s easy to understand and maintain.
I work mostly with React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Android (Jetpack Compose), and I’m also an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate.
Always eager to learn new tools and patterns to improve how I build — whether that’s refining component structure in React or improving app flow in Compose. I like working on products that have real impact, where I can grow as a developer and collaborate with people who care about quality.
